# EXCEL-PROJECT
The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.
Data Modelling
Okay, we’re nearly there! You’re doing a great job. 

Now we want to figure out the top 5 categories. To complete your data modelling, follow these steps:

1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together

We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
Hint: You can use a “VLookUp” formula
 
2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories

Add up the total scores for each category.
Hint: You can use the “Sum If” formula

The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:

A cleaned dataset
The top 5 categories
 
Once you have a final data file, upload it to complete this task! We'll provide you with some explanation videos in the next step - but first give it a go to see if you can figure it out. 

You can use Excel or any other tool of your choice to create your final data set.
